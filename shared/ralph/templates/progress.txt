## Codebase Patterns

<!--
Add reusable patterns here as you discover them.
Future iterations read this section FIRST.

Examples:
- API response format: { success: boolean, data?: T, error?: string }
- Form validation: Use Zod schema with react-hook-form
- Error handling: Wrap async handlers in try/catch, return standardized error
- Test patterns: Mocking strategies, test utilities, assertion helpers
-->

## Iterations

<!--
Append after each completed story using TDD format:

## [Story ID]: [Story Title]
Timestamp: [current date/time]

### TDD Evidence
Failing tests before implementation:
- ✗ "test description" - TestFile.test.tsx

Test run output (red phase):
FAIL path/to/TestFile.test.tsx
  ✕ test description (5ms)
Tests: N failed, 0 passed

### Implemented
- What was built/changed

### Files
- path/to/file.test.ts (created - TDD)
- path/to/file.ts (created)

### Final Test Results
Tests: X passed, 0 failed
Coverage: Y% (if available)

### Policy Review
Security: [concerns addressed / n/a: no security-relevant changes]
NFR: [concerns addressed / n/a]
Standards: [confirmed / deviations noted]

### Completion Gates
Coverage: [X% on new files / not measured]
Integration test: [path | n/a: no cross-boundary changes]
Performance: [no concern | benchmark: path]

### Patterns Discovered
- Any reusable patterns

### Notes for Future Iterations
- Gotchas, edge cases, context
